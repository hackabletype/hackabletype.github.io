This book design was done for Douglas R. Hodginsâ€™ [Millionaire Down the Road](http://millionairedowntheroad.com). My role was to design the page layout, as well as do the information and cover design. I also coordinated the illustration for the cover (finding an illustrator, and liaising between them and the author). The cover illustration was done by [Yvonne Ren](mailto:ren.yvonne@gmail.com).
