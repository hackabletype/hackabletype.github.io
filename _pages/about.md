Nate Waddington is a Senior Creative Technologist at AKQA in San Francisco.
At AKQA he works with the Experiential Team—working with the Technology Department, designers and clients—to build interactive installations for retail spaces, conferneces and other events.
His interests extend to interaction design, writing, photography and of course computing.
He is proud of his standing as a Jack of all trades.

Prior to working at AKQA, Nate spent time in the Graduate School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University, and has received a Bachelor's degree from the same program.
During his graduate studies he was primarily interested in everyday design and appropriation (looking at how people who are not trained designers work with mundane objects and appropriate these things to better suit their needs).
Prior to his university studies he spent five years as a programmer specializing in embedded systems.
His experience with embedded systems (small devices, usually lacking an operating system) has lead him to work on a lot of projects designing physical, tangible, and mobile devices.
