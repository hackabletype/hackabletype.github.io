Nathan Waddington is an interaction designer, writer, photographer and computer wonk. He is proud of his standing as a Jack of all trades. His primary design focus is on user interaction, how people use things. He has spent time in the Graduate School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University, and received a Bachelor's degree from the same program. During his graduate studies he was primarily interested in everyday design and appropriation (looking at how people who are not trained designers work with mundane objects and appropriate these things to better suit their needs). Prior to his university studies he spent five years as a programmer specializing in embedded systems. His experience with embedded systems (small devices, usually lacking an operating system) has lead him to do a lot of projects designing physical, tangible, and mobile devices.
